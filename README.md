# Login-and-Register-app-Frontend-part

This project is a user-friendly frontend web application designed for handling user registration and login functionalities. It is developed using basic web technologies â€” HTML for structuring the content, CSS for designing a clean and attractive user interface, and JavaScript for dynamic interaction. The main page (index.html) features a registration form with input fields for name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password, along with a "Login" link. The style.css file enhances the visual appeal with soft color themes, rounded borders, hover effects, shadows, and a centered layout to ensure a good user experience. The script.js file enables smooth form switching: when the user clicks the "Login" link, it dynamically replaces the register form with a login form on the same page, and includes a "Back to Register" option to return to the original form. This makes the app feel interactive and seamless without loading a new page. To run this app in VS Code, open the folder containing the files, install the Live Server extension, then right-click on index.html and choose "Open with Live Server" to launch it in your browser. This simple yet functional project is ideal for practicing core frontend development skills.
